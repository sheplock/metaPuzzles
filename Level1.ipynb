    "One thing I'm worried about is whether it's possible that I could get a different answer depending exactly how I fill the seats, whether going up or going down. I think I may be OK though because of symmetry though. For example, say there's diners at 2 and 7 with $K=1$. I could put a diner at 4 (1 open to left and 2 to right) or 5 (2 open to left and 1 to right). If the original diner is in 8 rather than 7, I can fit 2 diners in seats 4 and 6, and it doesn't matter whether I start at the left or right. If the diners are at 2 and 9, I can start at 2 going up and put diners at 4 and 6, or I can start at 9 and go down, putting diners at 7 and 5. I get different orientations but the same number of new diners. This is not a proof that I'll be OK in all situations but I can't immediately come up with a scenario counter to my intuition so I think I'm OK and I'll proceed and see if I run into any obvious issues.

    "Moving onto Step 2 in the above sketch. Given a diner at $S_1 \\leq S_i$ for all $i$, I want to try to fit in as many diners in the seats to the left. Rather than looping through and adding diners, one by one I can just use division to determine where diners can go. I am essentially trying to place $K + 1$ blocks into these seats (1 for the diner plus $K$ seats to one side. If everyone has $K$ seats on one side of them then the distancing requirements will be satisfied). Therefore, I just need the number of whole $K + 1$ pieces I can fit in to the $S_1 - 1$ seats. This is given by integer division, which drops the remainder. Similarly, for $S_M$, I want to fit $K + 1$ pieces into the $N - S_M$ rightmost seats. "

    "Working through that arithmetic above, I see that I can modify Step 4 above and not worry about how exactly I fill the seats. Given diners at $S_i$ and $S_{i+1}$ I can use a similar caluclation to fit $K + 1$ pieces between the diners. The one slight difference is that with $S_1$ and $S_M$, I didn't need to worry about one of the boundaries; I could put a diner at seat $1$ or $N$ without meeting the distancing requirement on that side since there were no more seats to one side. Now I need to make sure that the diners I place meet the requirements on both sides. If I just place $K + 1$ blocks between the diners, I risk accidentally putting a diner too close to $S_i$ or $S_{i+1}$. If the $K + 1$ block has the diner with $K$ empty seats to the right, I need to make sure I remove the $K$ seats to the right of $S_i$ from consideration. Similarly, if I imagine the block are a diner with $K$ seats to the left, I can't place this block within $K$ seats of $S_{i+1}$. Either way this is a subtraction of $K$ seats, i.e. I am putting $K + 1$ blocks into a set of $S_{i+1} - S_i - 1 - K$ seats. "

There's a sense of order, so I can remove the first item, to keep only the $K$ most recent dishes eaten. But it should still have fast lookup for whether a $D_i$ is a key. The values will all be `None`."

Similarly, the $10^1$ order of magnitude similarly has $9$ uniform integers: $11, 22, 33, \\dots, 99$. For each entire order of magnitude spanned between $A$ and $B$, we will count $9$ uniform integers. \n",

Looking at sample test case 1, since $A = 75$ is less than $77$, we pick up $3$ uniform integers in the $10^1$ order of magnitude ($77, 88, 99$). Then, since $300$ is less than $333$ we only pick up $2$ unfirorm integers from the $10^2$ order ($111, 222$). For a total of $5$.\n",
